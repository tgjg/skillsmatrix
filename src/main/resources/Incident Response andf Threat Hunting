Advanced Incident Response and Threat Hunting
Real Incident Response Tactics

    Preparation: Key tools, techniques, and procedures that an incident response team needs to respond properly to intrusions
    Identification/Scoping: Proper scoping of an incident and detecting all compromised systems in the enterprise
    Containment/Intelligence Development: Restricting access, monitoring, and learning about the adversary in order to develop threat intelligence
    Eradication/Remediation: Determining and executing key steps that must be taken to help stop the current incident and the move to real-time remediation
    Recovery: Recording of the threat intelligence to be used in the event of a similar adversary returning to the enterprise
    Avoiding "Whack-A-Mole" Incident Response: Going beyond immediate eradication without proper incident scoping/containment
